we're switching from weather.gov to https://open-meteo.com/en/docs for our weather api calls 
due to fact that they offer far more services than we have access to with weather.gov.
    -elevation
    -historical weather
    -climate change
    -air quality etc.

need to fix existing issues with a KeyError when choosing between zip and address
would love to find a new provider for address geocoding as well.
good potential is https://www.geoapify.com.

would love to integrate their reachability feature
